# XGBoost-Classification-Assignment

## Part 1: Kaggle Competition "Predict Student Performance from Game Play"
- I could not figure out a way to unpack and process the training data that was nearly 5GB in size.  I instead, downloaded the notebook created by CHRIS DEOTTE, entitled "XGBoost Baseline - [0.680]", and worked through his notebook and competition submission.
- I did not know how to get the "jo_wilder" package to be installed in my virtual environment, so I was unable to run the final code to generate any predicitons.

## Part 2: Kaggle Competition "Predict Student Performance from Game Play"
- Once again, I had no idea where to begin with this project and for the sake of time, I downloaded and read through the notebook submission by SANSKAR HASIJA, entitled "[Playground S-3,E-4] ðŸ“ŠEDA + ModellingðŸ“ˆ" in order to try and understand how XGBClassifier could be used in this competition.  
- I did, however, edit the original notebook, removing the catboost and attempting to use a GridSearch with XGBClassifier in order to better tune the model.  I submitted these predictions to determine where the score would land in the leaderboard.

Scores were: 
- Public Score = 0.82434 (371st place)
- Private Score =  0.80676 (294th place)
